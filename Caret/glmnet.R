## Structure
# extension of the glm function in r, they have built-in variable selection,
#it helps linear regression to deal with collinearity and small sample sizes

#Ridge and Lasso Regression can be used for this penalization. They pair well
#with random forest models. glmnet models can fit a combined lasso and ridge regression
#too. alpha = 0 pure ridge, =1 lasso regression. lambda is the size of the penalty. 

#Lets use sonar dataset for this.
